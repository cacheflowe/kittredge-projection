## TODO

Playlist:
- Launch
  - [SOULD BE GOOD] Make sure Autosave is off w/.env var for is_production
  - Bypass half-resolution TOP
  - Upgrade TD version on Production to match latest dev version
  - [Check w/Moke] Add a play progress bar - needs to be implemented per-visual, either with timer or movie progress


- Nice-to-haves
  - Refactor app stokre keys into constants
  - Add a Web UI to control the playlist?
  - Rebuild active playlist as text TOP for nicer UI display
- Other
  - Build out my new art - Moke will pay $5k???
  - Curate another artist to show real-time work
  - Can we switch between viz modes on the fly? Or day-to-day?

Original viz - Maybes
- Sometimes some of the particles should assume an alternate mode of behavior for variety?
- Try a different curve on scale show/hide in particle?
- Add more movement modes
- add UI for different modes
- add different color cycling modes/evolution
- use vertex shader to move grouped shapes - will be a big change

Convoluted viz
- How to add color dye into the mix?
- Occasional clearing & re-seeding
  - Particles / wipes / large particle wipe
- Should make a white outline around windows when screen clears!
- Add noise map displacement?
- PennerFloat
  - Set inc to be responsive to start/stop value on PennerFloat objects
  - Implement an actual curve - right now it's linear
